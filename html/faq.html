<h3>Q: Is TimePulse production ready?</h3>

<p><b>A:</b> Yes. We have been using TimePulse as the primary time tracking and invoicing system at Logical Reality Design for several years. We found it to be easier to use and more powerful for our purposes than any of the commercial solutions available.</p>

<p>At the same time, our company is relatively small, so TimePulse has not been tested in an environment where there more than 10 employees. It's not entirely geared towards that either-- it's primarily for small businesses and contract shops like ours. Moreover since we've used it only internally, fixing little quirks in TimePulse that don't impede us from doing our work has not been a high priority up to this point. Going forward, we hope to fix these and welcome support from the community in doing so.</p>

<h3>Q: Do you offer a hosted version of TimePulse?</h3>

<p><b>A:</b> We do not offer a hosted version of TimePulse at this time. However, we hope to do so in the near future.</p>

<a name="future">
<h3>Q: What are the future plans for TimePulse?</h3>

<p><b>A:</b> We hope to add a number of features to TimePulse in the near future.</p>

<p>Our next major step is to turn TimePulse into a single page Javascript application. We've been eyeing closely the development of frameworks like Ember.js and Angular.js, and we're pleased to announce we'll converting TimePulse to both simultaneously! As our company has transitioned to writing apps with Javascript MVC's, we've had trouble finding a single solid tutorial that shows you how to actually convert a real world, sizable application to either Ember or Angular. So we've decided to write our own! We will be doing simultaneous ports of TimePulse to both Angular.js and Ember.js, and writing our tutorial as we go. Stay tuned for the best, most comprehensive tutorial on Javascript MVC ever, brought to you by Logical Reality Design.</p>

<p>Outside this major process, we are also improving our reporting features, and always looking to make minor improvements. We welcome suggestions on the future of TimePulse from the community!</p>

<h3>Q: I found a problem with TimePulse! Where do I submit a bug?</h3>
