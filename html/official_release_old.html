<p><a href="http://lrdesign.com">Logical Reality Design</a> is a team of contract web developers and designers. We've been building client projects for years, and we've built up pretty strong opinions about how to track time and report our hours. We also hate how intrusive a time tracking system can get on the normal flow of creative work.</p>
<p>There are rafts of time tracking approaches available already, but for one reason or another, none of them suited our purposes and values. We function as a team of independent professionals, so tools that started with the assumption of a boss/employee relationship didn't work for us. We also a fanatically parsimonious about our tracking of hours, so systems that round to the nearest quarter hour were out. We also feel strongly about choosing our own tools, so tools that didn't support Linux or Windows or Mac were out.</p>
<p>For a long time, we got by on spreadsheets. We marked time as we went on paper and entered it in spreadsheet form, and compiled and assembled them. It was expedient, but the workflow was terrible. And one day we turned to each other and said "how hard can this be?"</p>
<p>Well, we had something usable right away, but three years later we have something we're really happy to be working with. We've tinkered with it over time to be exactly what we want to be, and it's cozy like a warm sweater.</p>
<p>The same reasoning that led us to begin Timepulse, led us to think no one else would want to use it. After all, we started this project because the specific things we wanted in a time tracking application weren't what anyone else would want. For a long time it'd seemed like no one else would what what we wanted.</p>
<p>Since then, though, we've heard from several people that it would useful to them. Other creative professionals <em>do</em> have the same needs we do, and have wished there were something that suited them.</p>
<p>What we also realized was that if there had been an open source project when we'd gotten started, we might've contributed to it rather than going our own way, and everyone would be better off.</p>
<p>Which is why we're so excited to announce the open source release of our time tracking application <a href="http://timepulse.io/">TimePulse.</a> We hope it's something that's useful to you.</p>
