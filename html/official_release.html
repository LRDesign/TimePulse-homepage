<p><a href="http://lrdesign.com"><img src="/assets/logo.png" width="944" height="360" />Logical Reality Design</a> is a team of contract web developers and designers. We've built client projects for years, and we have strong opinions about how to track time and report hours-- we don't want our time tracking system to interrupt normal flow of our creative work.</p>
<p>There are several time tracking approaches available already, but none of them suited our specific purposes and values. We function as a team of independent professionals, so tools that started with the assumption of a boss/employee relationship didn't work for us. We also fanatically stringent about our tracking of hours, so systems that round to the nearest quarter hour were out. We feel strongly about choosing our own tools, so tools that didn't support Linux or Windows or Mac were out. For a long time, we got by on spreadsheets, but the workflow was terrible. And one day we turned to each other and said "how hard can this be?"</p>
<p>We had something usable right away, but three years later we have something we're really happy to be working with. We've tinkered with it over time to be exactly what we want to be, and it's cozy like a warm sweater.</p>
<p>The same reasoning that led us to begin Timepulse, initially led us to think no one else would want to use it. We started this project because the specific things unique to our company and didn't think it would suite other companies needs. Since then, though, we've heard from several people that it would useful to them. Other creative professionals <em>do</em> have the same needs we do, and have wished there were something that suited them. We also realized was that if there had been an open source project when we'd gotten started, we might've contributed to it rather than going our own way. Everyone would be better off with this approach.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, we're so excited to announce the open source release of our time tracking application <a href="http://timepulse.io/">TimePulse.</a> We hope it's something that's useful to you-- as a full fledged time tracking system, as a tool to manage your work, as a learning project for new Rails developers. We believe in open source, and in sharing of resources between small businesses like ours. This is our contribution.</p>
<p>p.s. We have one more reason for releasing TimePulse. We're moving to using Angular.js and Ember.js more and we needed a project to practice transitioning to single page Javascript architecture. We decided to use TimePulse, and then we decided document our transition for others to learn from. Stay tuned in the coming months for our comprehensive tutorial on Ember and Angular, built on TimePulse!</p>
